## About

For our hackathon, we have decided to recreate Space Invaders using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We set out with the intention of creating a functional game that displays the essential pieces that make the game fun and playable.

## Wireframes

## UX (User Experience)
Initially, we input out project goals into GitHub Copilot and had it generate user stories that would relate to the creation of Space Invaders.

Our strategy for this ensured that we had a clear cut understanding of what a user would expect from a simple web-based application and we refined our results to match the scope of our project and timeframe.

After generating the <a href="#wireframes">wireframes</a> we set about to create our design visually (as shown above). We achieved a parralax effect that moves based on the cursor position for the main menu and overlayed a retro effect using gradients and an image of darkened screen corners that represent <abbr title="Cathode Ray Tube">CRT</abbr> monitors and arcade cabinets.
